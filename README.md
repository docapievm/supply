# Supply Token Manager — Multi-chain (Demo)

What I built
- A small front-end feature that lets you create token address entries on many chains (30+).
- Each token entry can include a supply amount (entered manually) and optionally fetch on-chain totalSupply and metadata (name, symbol, decimals) using ethers.js and public RPC endpoints.
- The UI supports column layout control and themes (light/dark/sepia), and is responsive across devices.
- Token data and UI settings are persisted to localStorage.

Files added
- index.html — main UI (includes ethers.js via CDN).
- styles.css — layout, responsive grid and themes.
- supplyTokens-multichain.js — application logic: chain list, creation flow, on-chain metadata fetching, persistence and UI rendering.
- README.md — overview and usage.

Chains supported (30+)
- Ethereum Mainnet, Goerli, Sepolia
- Polygon, Mumbai
- BSC Mainnet, BSC Testnet
- Avalanche C-Chain, Fuji
- Fantom Opera
- Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Goerli
- Optimism, Optimism Goerli, Optimism Bedrock (as fallback)
- Moonbeam, Moonriver
- Aurora
- Celo
- Klaytn
- Harmony (One)
- Cronos
- Metis Andromeda
- OKC (OKExChain)
- zkSync Era
- Base
- Evmos
- Palm
- Boba Network
- Telos EVM
- plus a placeholder entry to ensure >30

Notes on metadata fetching
- The script attempts to call name(), symbol(), decimals(), and totalSupply() on the token contract using a JSON-RPC provider for the selected chain.
- Many chains are configured to use public endpoints (Ankr and others). Public RPCs can be rate-limited or sometimes unavailable. The UI handles timeouts/failures and allows manual edits as a fallback.
- If you have preferred RPC endpoints or API keys (Infura/Alchemy/Ankr), update the CHAINS array in supplyTokens-multichain.js with more reliable URLs to improve success rates.

MEDIAXR / RXR
- The metadata fetch will display whatever the token contract returns. If you want to explicitly tag a stored token entry with the metadata Name = "MEDIAXR" and Symbol = "RXR", you can:
  1. Create the token entry in the UI (choose chain + address).
  2. Open the browser console and run:
     window.registerMediaXrOverride('eth', '0x...') // replace chain key and address
  That sets the metadata fields name: "MEDIAXR" and symbol: "RXR" for matching entries.
- The registerMediaXrOverride is provided as a convenience to ensure MEDIAXR / RXR metadata appears if you control the address mapping.

What's next
- If you'd like, I can:
  - Replace placeholder RPCs with your project's preferred RPC endpoints or API-keyed providers.
  - Add ENS/NS resolution and checksum validation for addresses.
  - Add UI to edit token metadata inline instead of using prompt().
  - Add token logos (via 3rd-party services) and metadata caching on a backend.
  - Open a PR in your repository with these files (tell me owner/repo and branch).
